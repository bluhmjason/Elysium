This is a guessing game, it's my first creation and I'm hoping to create some more in c#.
From start it will ask you f you want to play.
Accepting generates a random number between 1 and 20.
It gives the user 7 tries to guess the right number.
Counting down with every guess.
Win or lose it runs a multiple ending screens.
